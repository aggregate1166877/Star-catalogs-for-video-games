## Amendments
Amendments can be made by modifying or adding new data to the files located in
ammendmentFactory.

In order for an amendment to be effective, the name used to identify the object
needs to be consistent or we'll end up with multiple amendments overwriting
each other. Specifically, we need to avoid referring to a single celestial body
by more than one name.

#### Standard
The standard for overrides followed in this catalog are as follows:<br>

Refer to the object by its generated line ID. In case we ever need to verify
information, we 3 fallback names need to be specified as well. If the object
has fewer than 3 names, specify all of them as fallbacks. At least 1 fallback
name needs to be specified for and change to be accepted.

Add a comment (using `//`) stating why this change was made. Changes without
reason will not be accepted.

Please keep line numbers in numeric order when adding data.
